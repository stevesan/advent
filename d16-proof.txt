suppose there was a case where A <= B, but actually A could go on to be better than B.

we know they're at the position X


(1) if A's valves are a strict subset of B's, then any valve A can newly open, B can also newly open by trivially following the same steps as A. And because start conditions are the same, B will definitely be >= then A on all numbers.
  or if A opens a valve that B already has open, B gains even more advantage because it already has it opened.

(2) What if A's valves are NOT a subset?

  let U be the intersection of A's and B's valves.
  let P be A's valves - U
  let Q be B's valves - U
  
  rate(A) = rate(P) + rate(U)
  rate(B) = rate(Q) + rate(U)
  we know:
  rate(P) + rate(U) <= rate(Q) + rate(U)
  thusL
  rate(P) <= rate(Q)

WLOG we can assume that A took the optimal route to turn on its valves.

  it's now possible for A to open up valves in Q to gain rate...ok, and if it kept doing that, eventually it'd exceed B's rate..
  but B doesn't just sit still here.. B can start opening valves in P now too...

  because of symmetry of paths, we know that from the current spot X, time(P+U) >= time(Q+U)
  let's assume time(P) >= time(Q) (pretty sure this is fine if A and B are optimal for their valves)

  so it may take more time for B to open P than for A to open rest of Q...but in that time, B was accumulating pressure at a higher rate.
